        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Learning languages</h3>
        <p>Speaking English might not be enough if you’re planning on developing your career. 
        The three fastest-emerging languages of global consumers are Russian, Hindi, and Japanese.
        Studies have found a correlation between learning languages and problem-solving abilities, 
        intelligence, and memory skills.</p>
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>Photography is so much more than just taking pictures. It develops conceptual skills and technical expertise,
             but also teaches how to collaborate with others. </p>
        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>Curiosity, courage, and self-organization. Traveling can prove you’re not afraid of stepping outside your comfort 
            zone and learning new things. And flexibility and adaptability are 
            among the most important workplace personal traits.</p>
        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>It doesn’t matter what sport you do. Exercising in general develops self-discipline,
             patience, and helps bounce back from disappointment. Team sports create opportunities to improve leadership,
             communication, and interpersonal skills, too.</p>
        <h3>Yoga</h3>
        <p>You might say yoga is a type of sport, but it’s much more than stretching. It also involves concentrating on breathing
             and is a great way to relax your mind. 
            And data shows a relaxed employee is less likely to leave their job.</p>
        <h3>Dance</h3>
        <p>Dancing isn’t just fun. It’s a social activity that teaches collaboration
             skills. It also boosts cognitive performance and helps to unwind.</p>
        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of jobs require creativity skills. Imagination and inventiveness are also parts of critical-thinking skills. 
            And research revealed that 93%
             of employers value critical thinking over the candidate’s undergraduate degree. </p>
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>It doesn’t matter if it’s romance books that you read. Reading shows you follow your passions.
             It also prevents cognitive decline and reduces stress. And helps maintain work-life balance. </p>
        <h3>Listening to music</h3>
        <p>Listening to music lowers stress and elevates your mood. It strengthens learning and memory abilities, too. In the ever-changing corporate world 
            being able to learn new things
             on a daily basis is a top employability skill (especially in the rise of AI).</p>
